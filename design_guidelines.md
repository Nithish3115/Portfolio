## Animations & Interactions

**Entry Animations:**

- Sections: Fade in on scroll intersection (use Intersection Observer)
- Cards: Stagger fade-in when visible

**Hover States:**
- Cards: transform scale(1.02), enhanced shadow/glow
- Buttons: Subtle background shift, scale(1.05)
- Project images: Zoom in slightly (scale(1.1))
- Links: Underline slide-in animation

**Scroll Effects:**
- Parallax on hero background elements (subtle, 0.5 speed)
- Navbar background blur increases on scroll
- Progress bar at top showing scroll percentage
- Section titles fade + translate on approach

**Performance:** Use CSS transforms and opacity only, GPU acceleration, reduce motion respected

## Glassmorphism Implementation

**Glass Cards:**
- Backdrop blur: backdrop-blur-xl
- Semi-transparent backgrounds
- Subtle border with gradient
- Layered shadow effects (multiple box-shadows)

**Application:**
- Navigation bar
- Project cards
- Skill pills
- Achievement badges
- Contact form container

## Images

**Hero Section:**
- Professional photo or 3D animated avatar (right side)
- Size: 400x400px on desktop, circular or rounded-3xl frame
- Subtle glow/neon border effect
- Consider animated floating/rotating effect

**Project Thumbnails:**
- 4 high-quality mockups/screenshots (1200x675px recommended)
- Show UI in action where possible
- For each project: Tonal Emotion Recognition (dashboard/waveforms), KMRL (transportation UI), Alankar (music app interface), Thirukurral (chatbot interface)

**About Section:**
- Professional headshot (600x600px)
- Clean background, good lighting
- Positioned left side with glassmorphic frame

---

## Dark Theme Implementation

**Primary Approach:** Dark theme as default with toggle option
- True dark backgrounds (near black, not pure black)
- High contrast text for readability
- Reduced opacity overlays for depth
- Neon accent colors for CTAs and highlights
- Gradient overlays for visual interest without overwhelming

## Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 768px (stack all columns, larger touch targets)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (2-column layouts)
- Desktop: > 1024px (full multi-column layouts)

**Mobile Priorities:**
- Hamburger navigation
- Single column layouts
- Reduced animation complexity
- Touch-optimized button sizes (min 44x44px)
- Optimized image loading
